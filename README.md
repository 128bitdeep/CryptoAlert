# CryptoAlert

The bot monitors selected Crypto tokens, you can remove and add the tokens you want to monitor under main.py.

Currently, the bot is discontinued with Error 451; which can be solved by changing the API instead of binance which can be found in main as well.

Keep alive is bound to keep the server alive; if running in local, there is no need of that.

You can expect the output as below:
